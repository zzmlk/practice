<h1>Nothing to My Name</h1>

<pre>
    I've kept asking you, when will you go with me?
    But you always laugh at me, with nothing to my name
    I want to give you my <del>dreams,</del> and my <del>freedom</del>
    But you always laugh at me, with nothing to my name
 
    Oh, when will you come with me? 
    The Earth below is moving, the river beside me flowing
    But you always laugh at me, with nothing to my name
    Why do you laugh at me? Because I don't give up?
    In your eyes, will I always have nothing to my name?
    Oh, when will you come with me? 
    The Earth below is moving, the river beside me flowing 
 
    Listen: I've waited so long, listen to my last request
    I want to grab your hands, and take you with me
    Now your hands are trembling, now your tears are falling
    Are you telling me you love me, with nothing to my name?
 
    Oh, now come with me 
    The Earth below is moving, the river beside me flowing 
    Oh, now come with me 

 </pre>
